## Project Description
The goal was to make AI learn different objects Such as a remote Playstation 4 controller and Bible. This project was difficult at first but after adding a few more photos AI was able to have a greater confidence.
## Classes Identified
Bible
Remote
Playstation 4 controller
## Discussion & Reflection
**Accuracy of first model**
The first version confused remote with Bible and PS4 controller with ease
**Iteration steps**
I added more photos to the remote making the confidence to almost 100 percent
**Most Challenging objects**
The remote and viable were difficult because they were both black rectangle objects
**Bias in AI**
If I only trained on my specific bible then it would likely fail because not all Bibles are black and that small.
**Model Limitations**
The model struggled with the use of different backgrounds and similar shaped objects.
**Real-World Applications**
This will be helpful identifying home inventory management making it useful to sort through items. This system could be your personal assistant, guiding Maybe a blind person or someone with disabilities making it easier for them to manage their home.
